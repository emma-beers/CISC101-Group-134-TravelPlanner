Updated distance rule to support "short walks only" preference. Activities within 25 minutes walking time are prioritized when the user specifies "short walks only".
Short-walk preference handling:
If user preference includes "short walks only", the planner will prioritize activities within a 25-minute walking radius by default.
If no suitable activities exist within 25 minutes, expand to 40 minutes and present both short and alternative options labeled "short-walk alternatives."
