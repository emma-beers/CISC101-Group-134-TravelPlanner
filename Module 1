Group Assignment
Objective: Compile outputs and write a 50-word reflection on using Markdown and Microsoft Copilot for prompt testing.

Steps:

Combine outputs into one Markdown file using the template below.
Write a 50-word reflection addressing: "What did you learn about using Markdown and Microsoft Copilot for prompt testing? How does this support computational thinking for Travel Planner prompts?"

# Week 2 Group Reflection

Emma Beers and Dylan Beers

## Set 1: Basic Travel Planner Prompt

### Task 1.1: Design and Test a Simple Itinerary Prompt
**Prompt**:
Generate a 1-day trip from Kingston to Ottawa on a $500 budget

**Transcript Link**:
https://copilot.microsoft.com/shares/339KYE98icG2UH2Uocv6Z

**Analysis**:
We included the duration, location and budget to help ensure the prompt is specific.

## Set 2: Decompose and Refine a Prompt

### Task 2.1: Prompt Decomposition Puzzle
**Decomposed Components**:
- Duration (3 days)
- Location (Paris) 
- Activity to do (Visit museums) 
- Place to Eat (Restraunt) 
- Hospitality (Hotel) 

**Prompt**:
Plan a 3-day trip to Paris which includes visiting 2 museums, 1 restraunt and staying at a hotel.

**Transcript Link**:

**Analysis**:
Decomposition improved clarity as the 5 components that were in the structured prompt reduced unwanted tasks to do in the 3-day trip.

## Set 3: Thinking Like and with an LLM

### Task 3.1: Prompt Reverse Engineering 
**Inferred Prompt**:
Create a structure for a travel planner that considers the city, days, budget, activity types and skip irrelevant data like weather. Use daily structure as a pattern and use step by step logic to generate iternerary for each day.

**Transcript Link**:
https://copilot.microsoft.com/shares/Cc6sQNMpZTiQHhZpDNHmH

**Analysis**:
The inferred prompt does not completley imitate the provided output since the inferred prompt provides a generic outline for a travel planner and does not match the provided output.

### Task 3.2: Applying Computational Thinking to the Travel Planner
**Transcript Link**:
https://copilot.microsoft.com/shares/BUxQD52Ni5svoWh5c8JWm

**Analysis**:
After reviewing 2.1 and output from 3.2, we want to prioritize the use of decompostion and pattern recognition for future implementation. 

## Set 4: Markdown Formatting Practice

### Task 4.1: Format LLM Output in Markdown
**Original Output Snippet**:
[Insert snippet]

**Formatted Markdown Version**:
[Insert formatted version]

**Analysis**:
[Insert 25-word analysis]

## Set 5: Prompt Error Prediction

### Task 5.1: Error Prediction Challenge
**Predicted Errors**:
[Insert list of predicted errors]

**Original Prompt**:
[Insert original prompt]

**Transcript Link**:
[Insert transcript link]

**Revised Prompt**:
[Insert revised prompt]

**Analysis**:
[Insert 25-word analysis]

## Reflection
Using Markdown and Microsoft Copilot made prompt testing clearer and easier. Markdown helped organize ideas neatly, while Copilot simplified refining prompts. Together, they supported computational thinking by encouraging decomposition, abstraction, and pattern recognition—keeping Travel Planner prompts focused, structured, and free from confusion or unnecessary details.


**Deliverables**: Markdown file (`week2_reflection.md`) with prompts, transcript links, analyses, and 50-word reflection.
